=head1 NAME

CalDAV::Simple::Task - a data class representing one task (VTODO) in a CalCAV calendar

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CalDAV::Simple::Task;
 my $task = CalDAV::Simple::Task->new(vcal_string => $string);
 printf "task '%s' is due '%s'\n", $task->summary, $task->due;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used to hold details of a single task from a CalDAV calendar.
It is alpha quality code. I don't really know much about CalDAV, but I've
been hacking around until I could get what I wanted working.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 summary

The short description / title of the task.

=head2 status

The CalDAV STATUS string for the task. I haven't looked into the different
values this can take.

=head2 uid

The CalDAV UID for the task.

=head2 etag

The L<HTTP etag|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag> for the task.

=head2 href

The relative URL for the task.

=head2 due

A L<DateTime> instance holding the due date for the task.

=head2 created

When the task was created. This will currently be returned as an ISO 8601 date+time
string, I think. In the future I'll make this return a L<DateTime> instance as well.

=head2 vcal_string

This is the string returned from the CalDAV server for a single task.
It's basically the C<d:response> element:

 <d:response>
    ...
    <cal:calendar-data>
      BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      ...
      END:VCALENDAR
    </cal:calendar-data>
    ...
 </d:response>

Hopefully you won't have to deal with this.

=head2 delete_task

Takes a task (instance of L<CalDAV::Simple::Task>) and deletes it
from the calendar.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<CalDAV::Simple> - the main module of this distribution, the C<tasks()>
method of which returns instances of C<CalDAV::Simple::Task>.
